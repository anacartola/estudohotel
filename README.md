# Data Science Study Room - Hotel Operations Analysis
At our esteemed ApartHotel, guest satisfaction is paramount. Lately, however, we've heard murmurs of discontent regarding the frequency of room cleanings. As these concerns grow, the management faces a critical decision: should we hire more cleaning staff, or can we optimize our current operations?

This case study leverages data analysis to provide insights into cleaning operations, using various Python libraries and tools to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis, enabling efficient handling and transformation of Excel data.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Used for creating informative visualizations, with Seaborn adding aesthetically pleasing statistical graphics.
- **Plotly Express**: Enhanced data visualization with interactive and high-quality plots.
- **NumPy and SciPy**: Employed for numerical computations and statistical analysis.

## Curiosities

A unique aspect of this study is the detailed examination of the correlation between room cleanliness scores and the number of cleanings performed. This analysis helped us understand whether increasing cleaning frequency would effectively improve guest satisfaction.

## Objectives

This case study not only addresses the immediate issue of cleanliness complaints but also provides a data-driven approach to optimizing cleaning operations, aiming to enhance guest experiences while managing operational costs effectively.
